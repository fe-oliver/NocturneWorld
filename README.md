#    Nocturne World

### ✨The beggining
It all started when I thought about doing the final project. At first, I wanted to use C language, cause I really liked it. But later, I noticed that I was just avoiding frontend, even during the course, I was just doing the necessary. And I have chosen not to keep with fear and not to contempt myself with the low level of skills that I had. That's when Nocturne World begun.

### 📝The planning
My first thought after the idea of creating a website with Flask, was to think about everything that I wanted to do. First of all what type of site? A blog, so I could talk about something that I enjoy. That way, it would be very satisfatying to create the blog, and it was. I have chosen Goth as the main theme of the project, and for that reason, I made a long search so as not to talk nonsense. I spen long weeks reading, listening and also writting all the content that the website displays. After couple searches, I planned exactlly what were the main subjects related to the goth subculture. I also planned how I wanted the layout of the blog, so as to start creating the folders to programm. One of the hardest parts of this project, was choosing the amount of content that I would talk about, and control my time on searching. But I managed to keep focus on the main content(and not in deatils) that would satisfy the needs of each page created.

### 👾app.py
##### I started by creating this folder, so as to set Flask during the coding process. I created routes to each part I had planned before. Which were: index, history, art, architecture, cinema, dance, literature, music, painting, sculpture, fashion and about. Each of them should return the template with the HTML content that I was creating for the blog, also redirect when necessary.

### 💻templates
##### A folder that holds every single HTML file in this project. I created the base template and the index, after that, I created one page for each subject in the site(basically for the arts, fashion and about).

### 🖌static
##### It's where is the style.css folder, to personalize the template's components and themselfes.
